To edit AltSnap settings, open the `AltSnap.ini` file located in `%APPDATA%\AltSnap` (usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\AltSnap`). Use any text editor (e.g., Notepad) to modify configuration options such as snapping behavior, hotkeys, exclusions, and UI preferences. Always back up the file before editing to avoid breaking functionality. Changes typically apply immediately or after restarting AltSnap.
