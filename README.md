# Configurations

This repository houses my personal configuration files (dotfiles) to customize and optimize my development environment on Windows. The focus is currently on tools like [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)  and [Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/). Future updates will include additional configurations, broadening the repository's support.

## Overview

- **NeoVim (`nvim/`)**: Contains the main configuration file (`init.vim` or `init.lua`) and plugin settings.
- **PowerShell (`powershell/`)**: Includes a custom profile script to enhance functionality and workflow.

## Future Plans

This repository will expand to include new features, offering:

- Custom configurations for various tools and environments.
- Optimized setups for terminal multiplexers and productivity tools.
- System-wide scripts and utilities to streamline workflows.

## Notes

These configurations are tailored to my preferences and workflow. However, feel free to explore and adapt them for your own use. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
